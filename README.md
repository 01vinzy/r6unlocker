# R6Unlocker

> Note: Don't blame me for the shitty HTML / CSS design and code, it's just a simple tool that writes some offsets to a process.

## About
With R6Unlocker, you can unlock all skins (including headgear, uniform, weapon skin, attachment) and all operators.
This works only while BattleEye is deactivated. You can use this to modify your save file to include some nice skins.

## Installation
Simply download the [latest release](https://github.com/Terax235/r6unlocker/releases/latest), open up Rainbow Six Siege and launch the tool. Use the GUI to unlock, lock or normalize all data.

## Updates
This tool can break if there are updates for Rainbow Six Siege. Since this app uses an auto updater, you should not have to worry about it once I've updated the regarding offsets.
