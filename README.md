# R6Unlocker

> Note: Don't blame me for the shitty HTML / CSS design and code, it's just a simple tool that writes some offsets to a process.

## About
With R6Unlocker, you can unlock all skins (including headgear, uniform, weapon skin, attachment) and all operators.
This works only while BattleEye is deactivated. You can use this to modify your save file to add some nice skins.

## Does every skin work?
Basically every skin that is available to purchase should work. I'm not sure which skins work and which don't, but for example elite skins should be fine while stuff from the Rainbow is Magic event will not be shown in game as soon as you return to the normal save.
You can use every skin while running the Unlock All, though. This will only work in local games / terrorist grounds, except if you have a bypass to play online.

## Installation
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Terax235/r6unlocker/releases/latest) (only the `.exe` file is needed)
2. Launch Rainbow Six Siege with BattleEye deactivated. This is required, else you will get kicked out while trying to change offsets. Disabling BattleEye means that you can't play matches online for the time, but you can still modify the savegame to add skins you want.
> You can deactivate BattleEye by adding `/belaunch -be` to the start arguments. In a future version, I will also support starting the game directly using the tool
3. Launch the `.exe` once you are in menu
4. Now you can select *Unlock All* to unlock all operators and skins, or *Normal* to set your progress to normal.

## Updates
If there is an update for Rainbow Six Siege, there is a likely chance that this tool will break. I will then update the regarding offsets as soon as possible. If you use the `.exe`, you can simply wait until I've published a new release. The app will automatically get updated.
